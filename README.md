# Territorial analysis of the city on a micro level

###### This is the POC project which I'm creating for Bachelor degree for faculty at Computer Science in University of Ljubljana

## Idea
I am creating a tool, which can help anyone who want to learn and see how and analyze why 
people travel from one place to other inside the city (micro level). This tool is analyzing 
and filter by your wishes. You can choose custom filters, filter out some travel types, or
you can filter just particular locations or by their type. Tool draw lines which is showing
actual path user took. You can analyze particular path by clicking on it. Pop up shows the 
few histograms with important data, which can then be analyzed.
